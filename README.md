# Cooked-GFG

Welcome to Cooked-GFG! 🍳✨
This repository is a collection of my daily practice questions from GeeksforGeeks, designed to sharpen problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation in Algorithms and Data Structures.

Each day is a step closer to mastering the art of coding, one question at a time. Whether you’re here for inspiration, collaboration, or learning, feel free to explore the code and join the grind!

🔑 Key Features:
	•	Daily Practice: Consistent updates with new problems and solutions.
	•	Java-Powered: All solutions are implemented in Java for clarity and efficiency.
	•	Mastery Over Time: Focused on improving algorithmic thinking and tackling complex problems.

Let’s keep striving and growing together in the world of coding! 💻🔥
